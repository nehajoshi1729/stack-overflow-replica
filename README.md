## Test cases

Tests are separated into individual .cy.js files based on the UseCase being tested. Files are named after the use cases they are testing (the only exception is for Comments, these tests are in Answers.cy.js). In the case of two use cases having identical names (such as difference in use case between registered user and guest), both sets of tests are contained in the same file.
